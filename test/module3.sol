// Module 2: What is my address?

// Task: Print the address of this account onto your console. 

// Reference: https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/cheatcodes?highlight=address(this)#cheatcodes

// Hint: There's a lot of questions to ponder here... How can we get the address of this account? What even does "this account" mean? Which account am I referring to? How do I print an address using console.log? 

// Test: Run forge test --mt test_3 -vv in your console

    function test_3() public {
